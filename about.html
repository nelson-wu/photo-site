Nelson is an artist working in the photographic medium, capturing candid, unposed scenes of street life. Born in 1997, Nelson has lived and photographed in different cities throughout the USA and Canada. 
Inspired by the works of Frank, Klein and Parr, Nelson aims to show an alternate, unfamiliar reality, as perceived by the lens and not the eye.
